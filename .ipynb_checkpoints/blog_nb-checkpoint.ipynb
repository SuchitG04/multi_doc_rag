The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\\n\\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm Versal™ ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership AI inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct™ ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm™ 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.', metadata={'pdf_title': 'AMD.10K.2023.pdf'}),\n",

Our strategy is to create and deliver the world’s leading high-performance and adaptive computing products across a diverse set of markets including the data center, embedded, client and gaming. Our strategy is focused on five strategic pillars: compute technology leadership, expanding data center leadership, enabling pervasive artificial intelligence (AI), providing software platforms and developer enablement, and designing custom silicon and solutions.\\n\\nWe invest in high-performance CPUs for cloud infrastructure, enterprise, edge, supercomputing, and PCs. We invest in high-performance GPUs and software for markets such as gaming, compute, AI, and virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). With the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (XIlinx) in February 2022, our product portfolio now includes FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs used in the data center and embedded markets. Also, with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. in May 2022, we offer high-performance DPUs and next generation data center solutions.\\n\\nWe leverage our high-performance CPU, GPU, FPGA and DPU product portfolios to deliver solutions that are differentiated at the chip level, such as our semi- custom SoCs, Adaptive SoCs, and APUs, and at the systems level, such as PCs, embedded platforms and servers. To expand our data center presence, we now offer the industry’s strongest portfolio of data center computing solutions based on our CPUs, high-performance GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoCs. We have a broad technology roadmap and products targeting AI training and inference spanning cloud, edge and intelligent endpoints. We achieve this through our family of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoCs.', metadata={'pdf_title': 'AMD.10K.2023.pdf'})]]"
